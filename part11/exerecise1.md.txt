For this exercise I chose the Python ecosystem. For linting the most commonly used tools are flake8, Pylint or Black.
These tools ensure that the code follows consistent formatting rules and catches bad practices before they turn into bugs.
For testing, the standart tool in Python is pytest, a simple and powerful framework for writing unit tests and integration tests.
In terms of building, Python apps are usually packaged using tools like setuptools,poetry or pip-build which create distribution-ready artifcats.
that can be deployed to servers.


Jenkins and GitHub actions as we learned are two reliable CI solutions. Other popular CI/CD 
can be GitLab Ci, Travis CI, CircleCI or Azure DevOps Pipelines. All of them allow automatic testing, building and deploying software.
The choice often depends on integration needs and cost. For our little and modest project, A cloud-based solution such as GitHub Actions
is easier to start with and may fit our team seamlessy. If this project succeeds and then we might have to start using our own software like Jenkins.
